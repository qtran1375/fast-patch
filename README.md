# Fast Patch

This is a simple tool to patch out the animations. Technically, I've also removed the photosensitive seizure warnings and other related startup movies. All you need to do is select your EFGame folder and the program will make a backup of your file and fetch the modded version of the data1.lpk from this repository
You can download the patcher here.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
